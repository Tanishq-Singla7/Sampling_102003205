The Python Notebook above calculates the accuracy of 5 different models on 5 different samples created using different sampling techniques.

The 5 Models used are:
1. Naive Bayes
2. Logistic Regression
3. K-Nearest Neighbours
4. Support Vector Machine
5. Decision Tree

The 5 Sampling Techniques used are:
1. Random Sampling
2. Stratified Sampling
3. Cluster Sampling
4. OverSampling
5. Undersampling

## The best accuracy achieved is 0.984716 with Decision Tree Model and Cluster Sampling Technique.

(The accuracy might vary for different rows picked in the sample when a sample is generated.)
